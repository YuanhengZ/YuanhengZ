# Read YuanhengZ
Welcome to the profile README for YuanhengZ's developer account at expandAI!

If you're here, chances are you're either my current co-worker or about to become one.

I primarily code in Python (about 80% of the time) with the remaining 20% dedicated to other tools of the trade. Iâ€™m a big fan of JetBrains IDEs and passionate about maintaining clean, well-structured code. That means I enjoy spending time on refactoring, writing tests, and creating thorough documentation.

Iâ€™m always on the lookout for ways to improve, so if you notice anything odd or could be better in my code, please donâ€™t hesitate to let me know!

On a personal note, one of my goals is to get better at C++.
